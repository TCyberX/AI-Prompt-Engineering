## Introducing Today's Project!

In this project, we're diving into prompt engineering. The art of crafting effective prompts for AI. We'll explore core techniques, experiment with meta-prompts, and even build prompt templates for real-world app use. It's all about learning!!!! 

### Tools and Techniques

The AI model I used was Chat GPT .Key techniques I learnt include reverse engineering, promt chaining, clarifying questions, meta-prompt creation.

### Project reflection

This project took me approximately 2 day 1 hour each day, of course adding a little special salt. The most challenging part was definitely writing my own prompt template. It really rewarding to see how you can tweak those prompts. 

I did this project to get familiar with prompt engineering. This project really help to meet my goals and build skills in how I can create templates that can help with automating prompt generation or build AI tools.

## Starting the Conversation

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting instructions to guide AI models toward specific, accurate, and useful outputs. AI tools use prompts behind the scene by converting user input clicks to prompts.

I started my project with a basic prompt, asking ChatGPT What should I do as a Cloud Security Specialist?






My initial impressions of the response is like to broad knowledge or genereric , it's missing the deep role in every day work for different kind of company.

## Basic Prompt Techniques

Foundational strategies help shape better AI responses. These include setting a clear role (like entry-level), asking clarifying questions, breaking tasks into smaller parts (decomposition), and being specific about output format, tone, length, lang.

Once I applied these techniques, the responses became clearer, more specific, and better aligned with the use case. The biggest improvement came from using clarifying questions they helped the AI focus and deliver more relevant answers.

## Advanced Techniques

Prompt chaining is an advanced technique where a request is broken into two parts. The output from the first prompt becomes the input for the second. For example, first asking for common scenarios, then using that to generate specific actions.



Self-critiquing is a technique where the AI is asked to evaluate the quality of its own response. ChatGPT returned a breakdown of strengths, areas for improvement, and even revised its answer based on its own feedback.

## Specialized Techniques

Reverse engineering helps when you want to craft a prompt that produces a specific type of response. I used it to analyze an existing post on the topic, then recreated a similar output using a prompt suggested by ChatGPT.



Creative frameworks are specific layouts for explainig different kinds of things. For example, the five W and one H A straightforward framework for exploring a topic comprehensively

## Meta Prompts

A meta-prompt is prompt that gets ChatGPT to become a prompt writer fo us. I structured my meta-prompt by layering multiple techniques, and writing headers for each technique e.g. role and audience context, decomposition, reverse engineering etc.



I tested my meta-prompt by asking it to generate a prompt related to AI in Cyber security, The generated prompt automatically incorporated like role, asking to clarify questions etc.

I noticed the generated prompt missed instructions I defined, like self critiquing, and it eventually lost context of frameworks and follow-up prompts. This is becuase the AI model was overwhelmed by the meta prompt instructions.
